# NixOS config
This repo contains my entire NixOS config for two different machines. The hardware-configuration.nix files are auto-generated. Machine specific code(like graphics drivers) is declared in configuration.nix. Configuration of modular parts of the config in nixosModules(like gaming) is defined in default.nix.
